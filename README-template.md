### What I learned

I learned about absolute positioning in CSS through the process of creating a QR code component. While working on this component, I needed to precisely position the QR code image within a container div. Absolute positioning allowed me to precisely control the placement of the QR code, ensuring it was centered and aligned exactly where I wanted it on the page.
